Welcome to **Learning from Scratch()**.

I'm Brennan, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at Deakin University, Australia. I created this blog to record my progress, document my notes, and share my learning with other learners.

This space reflects my belief that learning is a continuous journey. It is a process of breaking down complex ideas, starting from the basics, and building knowledge step by step.

## Interests

Beyond coding and data science, I enjoy reading books, spending time in nature, and continuously exploring new skills and perspectives.

I have also adopted five stray cats and one dog. They have been a big part of my life, and I miss them every day, especially my kitten Pandolf.

## My Philosophy

"Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together. The trick is to focus on the first small thing. Starting small is still starting, and small beginnings often lead to extraordinary endings."
â€” Vincent Van Gogh
