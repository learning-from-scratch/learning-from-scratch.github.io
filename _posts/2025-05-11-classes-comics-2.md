Our favorite feline coder is back with another round of paws-itively delightful programming lessons!

In this second part of the **Pandolf Learns OOP** series, Pandolf dives deeper into the magical world of **Object-Oriented Programming**. From **inheritance** and **interfaces** to **polymorphism**, **delegates**, and **lambdas**, this comic brings advanced concepts to life in a playful, clear, and accessible way.

If you missed the first issue, [check it out here](/posts/classes-comics-1/). Otherwise, let’s jump right into Part 2!

### 🐾 Issue #4: Inheritance and Interfaces

In this chapter, Pandolf learns about how **classes pass down behaviors** and how **interfaces** are like promises you must keep. Inheritance helps Pandolf carry useful tools from ancestors like `Animal`, while interfaces ensure Pandolf follows specific rules.

### 🔁 Issue #5: Polymorphism

Polymorphism means **“many forms”** – the same command behaves differently depending on the situation. Watch how Pandolf transforms into **Fire**, **Water**, and **Leaf** forms to demonstrate this powerful concept!

### ✨ Issue #6: Delegates and Lambdas

Pandolf discovers the magic of **delegates** (scrolls that carry commands) and **lambdas** (quick spells for in-line actions). This issue covers how behavior can be passed around and reused, making code more flexible and elegant.

Thanks for reading! I hope Pandolf’s journey made these advanced C# topics a little more playful and easier to grasp. Whether you're a beginner or brushing up on your knowledge, I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments below!

Stay curious and keep learning, one paw at a time.
