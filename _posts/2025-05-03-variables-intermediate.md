Welcome back! In the previous lesson, we learned the basics of variables (`int`, `string`, `double`, `bool`), assignment, simple arithmetic, and basic input/output. Now, let's dive deeper into C#
's type system and explore more ways to manipulate data.

This post covers:
*   More numeric types (`float`, `decimal`, `byte`, `short`, `long`) and when to choose them.
*   Defining values that don't change (`const`).
*   Letting the compiler figure out types (`var`).
*   Shorthand operators for common calculations (`+=`, `++`, etc.).

**(Prerequisite: Ensure you understand the concepts from the "Variables and Data Types" post.)**

## Lesson: Expanding Your Data Toolkit

### More Numeric Types: Precision and Range

In the beginner lesson, we used `int` for whole numbers and `double` for decimals. C# offers more options, allowing you to choose the best type based on the size and precision of the number you need to store.

**Integer Types (Whole Numbers):**

*   `byte`: Stores small positive whole numbers from 0 to 255. Uses only 1 byte of memory. Good for representing things like color components or small counts.
*   `short`: Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767. Uses 2 bytes.
*   `int`: The most common choice. Stores whole numbers from roughly -2.1 billion to +2.1 billion. Uses 4 bytes.
*   `long`: Stores very large whole numbers (up to +/- 9 quintillion!). Uses 8 bytes. Use this if `int` isn't big enough.

```csharp
byte age = 30;
short year = 2025;
int population = 1000000;
long nationalDebt = 15000000000000L; // Note the 'L' suffix for long literals

// Example: Trying to store a large number in a smaller type
// byte smallNum = 300; // Error! 300 is too large for a byte (max 255)
// int bigNum = 3000000000; // Error! 3 billion is too large for a standard int
long veryBigNum = 3000000000L; // OK! Use long for very large numbers
```

**Floating-Point Types (Decimal Numbers):**

*   `float`: Single-precision floating-point number. Less precise than `double` but uses less memory (4 bytes). Requires an `F` suffix on the literal value.
*   `double`: Double-precision floating-point number. The default choice for most decimal calculations. Uses 8 bytes.
*   `decimal`: High-precision decimal number. Excellent for financial calculations where rounding errors must be minimized. Uses 16 bytes and requires an `M` suffix on the literal value.

```csharp
float temperature = 98.6F; // Note the 'F'
double piApproximation = 3.1415926535;
decimal accountBalance = 1234.56M; // Note the 'M'
```

Choosing the right type helps manage memory usage and ensures calculations are performed with appropriate precision.

### Constants: Values That Never Change

Sometimes you have a value that should *never* be modified after it's set, like the mathematical constant Pi or a fixed configuration setting. For this, use the `const` keyword.

```csharp
const double Pi = 3.14159;
const int MaxUsers = 100;

// Pi = 3.14; // Error! Cannot assign to a constant.
// MaxUsers++; // Error! Cannot modify a constant.
```

Constants make your code safer (preventing accidental changes) and clearer (signaling that a value is fixed).

### Type Inference with `var`: Let the Compiler Decide

C# has a handy feature called **type inference**. If you declare a variable using the `var` keyword *and* initialize it in the same statement, the compiler will automatically figure out the correct data type based on the assigned value.

```csharp
var userAge = 30;         // Compiler infers this is an 'int'
var userName = "Alice";     // Compiler infers this is a 'string'
var itemPrice = 19.99;    // Compiler infers this is a 'double' (default for decimals)
var isActive = true;      // Compiler infers this is a 'bool'
var accountBalance = 100.50M; // Compiler infers 'decimal' because of the 'M'

// var score; // Error! 'var' requires you to assign a value immediately.

// Type is fixed after declaration with var
// userAge = "Thirty"; // Error! Cannot assign string to a variable inferred as int.
```

Using `var` can make code slightly shorter, especially with complex type names. However, use it when the type is obvious from the value assigned. Sometimes, explicitly stating the type (`int`, `string`, etc.) makes the code easier to read.

### Shorthand Operators: Doing More with Less

C# provides convenient shorthand operators for common operations like modifying a variable's value based on its current value.

**Compound Assignment Operators:**

These combine an arithmetic operation with assignment.

*   `+=` (Add and assign): `x += 5;` is the same as `x = x + 5;`
*   `-=` (Subtract and assign): `y -= 3;` is the same as `y = y - 3;`
*   `*=` (Multiply and assign): `z *= 2;` is the same as `z = z * 2;`
*   `/=` (Divide and assign): `w /= 4;` is the same as `w = w / 4;`
*   `%=` (Modulus and assign): `r %= 3;` is the same as `r = r % 3;` (remainder)

```csharp
int score = 10;
score += 5; // score is now 15

double price = 20.0;
price *= 0.9; // price is now 18.0 (applying a 10% discount)
```

**Increment and Decrement Operators:**

These add or subtract 1 from a variable.

*   `++` (Increment): `count++;` is the same as `count = count + 1;` or `count += 1;`
*   `--` (Decrement): `lives--;` is the same as `lives = lives - 1;` or `lives -= 1;`

```csharp
int counter = 0;
counter++; // counter is now 1

int remainingAttempts = 3;
remainingAttempts--; // remainingAttempts is now 2
```

*(Note: `++` and `--` can be placed before or after the variable (`++count` vs `count++`). This changes *when* the increment/decrement happens relative to using the variable's value in an expression, but we'll explore that nuance in more advanced topics. For now, using them after the variable (`count++`) is common and clear.)*

### A Note on Type Conversion Errors

In the previous lesson, we used `Convert.ToInt32()` and `Convert.ToDouble()`. What happens if the user types "hello" when asked for a number? The program crashes!

```csharp
Console.Write("Enter a number: ");
string input = Console.ReadLine();
// If input is "abc", this line will cause an error!
int number = Convert.ToInt32(input);
```

While full error handling is a more advanced topic, it's important to be aware that direct conversion can fail. We'll see safer ways to handle input later.

## Tutorial: Compound Interest Calculator

Let's practice using different numeric types (`decimal` for money), constants, and compound assignment operators to calculate simple compound interest.

**Objective:** Create a program that calculates the future value of an investment after a few years using a fixed annual interest rate.

**Prerequisites:** A C# console project.

**Step 1: Set up `Program.cs`**

```csharp
using System;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        const decimal AnnualInterestRate = 0.05M; // 5% interest rate as a constant
        int years = 3; // Number of years to calculate

        Console.Write("Enter the initial investment amount: ");
        string inputAmount = Console.ReadLine();

        // Convert input to decimal
        decimal principal = Convert.ToDecimal(inputAmount); // Using decimal for currency

        Console.WriteLine($"Initial Principal: {principal:C}"); // :C formats as currency
        Console.WriteLine($"Annual Interest Rate: {AnnualInterestRate:P}"); // :P formats as percentage
        Console.WriteLine($"Calculating for {years} years...");

        // Calculation loop will go here

        Console.WriteLine($"\nFinal value after {years} years: {principal:C}");
    }
}
```
*Explanation: We use `const decimal` for the rate and `decimal` for the money amount. We use `:C` and `:P` for currency and percentage formatting in the output.*

**Step 2: Calculate Interest Year by Year**

We'll simulate the interest calculation for each year. For simplicity, we'll just repeat the calculation `years` times (we'll learn proper loops soon!).

```csharp
    // ... inside Main, after initial setup ...

    // Year 1
    decimal interestYear1 = principal * AnnualInterestRate;
    principal += interestYear1; // Add interest to principal using +=
    Console.WriteLine($"After Year 1: {principal:C} (Interest: {interestYear1:C})");

    // Year 2
    decimal interestYear2 = principal * AnnualInterestRate;
    principal += interestYear2;
    Console.WriteLine($"After Year 2: {principal:C} (Interest: {interestYear2:C})");

    // Year 3
    decimal interestYear3 = principal * AnnualInterestRate;
    principal += interestYear3;
    Console.WriteLine($"After Year 3: {principal:C} (Interest: {interestYear3:C})");

    Console.WriteLine($"\nFinal value after {years} years: {principal:C}");
}
```
*Explanation: In each step, we calculate the interest earned for that year based on the *current* principal, then use `+=` to add that interest back to the principal.*

**Step 3: Build and Run**

1.  Save `Program.cs`.
2.  Build (`dotnet build`) and run (`dotnet run`).
3.  Enter an initial investment amount (e.g., 1000).

**Example Output (for input 1000):**

```
Enter the initial investment amount: 1000
Initial Principal: $1,000.00
Annual Interest Rate: 5.00 %
Calculating for 3 years...
After Year 1: $1,050.00 (Interest: $50.00)
After Year 2: $1,102.50 (Interest: $52.50)
After Year 3: $1,157.63 (Interest: $55.13)

Final value after 3 years: $1,157.63
```

## Exercise: Enhanced Rectangle Calculator

Let's enhance the Rectangle Calculator from the previous lesson.

**Project Goal:** Modify the Rectangle Calculator to:
1.  Use `double` for width and height to allow decimal inputs.
2.  Use `var` for declaring the `area` and `perimeter` variables.
3.  Use compound assignment or increment/decrement operators somewhere in your code (even if slightly contrived, just for practice - maybe track the number of calculations performed?).
4.  Display the area and perimeter formatted to 2 decimal places.

**Requirements:**

1.  Start with the code from the Beginner Rectangle Calculator mini-project.
2.  Change `int` variables for dimensions, area, and perimeter to `double` or use `var` where appropriate.
3.  Use `Convert.ToDouble()` for input conversion.
4.  Add a counter variable (e.g., `int calculationsPerformed = 0;`) and increment it (`calculationsPerformed++` or `calculationsPerformed += 1;`) after calculating area and perimeter.
5.  Format the output using string interpolation and format specifiers (e.g., `{area:F2}` for 2 decimal places).

**Hints:**

*   Formatting output: `Console.WriteLine($"Area: {area:F2}");`
*   Incrementing: `myCounter++;`

**Steps:**

1.  Modify your `RectangleCalculator` project code.
2.  Save, build, and run.
3.  Test with decimal inputs (e.g., width 10.5, height 5.2).
4.  Verify the output shows 2 decimal places and that your counter works (you'll need to print the counter value too!).

## Conclusion

This lesson expanded our knowledge of C# data types, introducing more specific integer and floating-point types (`byte`, `long`, `float`, `decimal`) and the concept of constants (`const`). We also learned convenient shortcuts like type inference (`var`) and compound assignment/increment/decrement operators (`+=`, `*=`, `++`, `--`). Understanding these helps write more efficient and appropriate code for different situations.
