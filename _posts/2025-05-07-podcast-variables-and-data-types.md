I'm thrilled to announce a new addition to this blog — **Learning from Scratch()**, a podcast series hosted by **me (Brennan)** and my co-host **Tala**!

Together, we break down programming, Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI concepts into clear, relatable ideas.

If you've been following my blog, you know my mission has always been to explain complex technology in simple, understandable terms. Now, Tala and I are bringing that same approach to audio!

### Why a podcast?

Technology can feel overwhelming — especially for beginners or those transitioning into programming or data science. I've often talked with students and colleagues who feel intimidated by jargon and the fast pace of tech advancements.

That’s why Tala and I created *Learning from Scratch()*. It’s a space for honest, down-to-earth conversations about the core ideas behind the technology we use every day.

No jargon. No assumptions. Just clear explanations — and a bit of fun along the way.

### About the first episode

In our **first episode**, Tala and I tackle a fundamental question:

> *How do computers remember and organize information?*

We explore key programming concepts like:
- **Variables** — how computers store data.
- **Data types** — different kinds of containers for different kinds of information.
- **Control flow** — how programs make decisions based on stored information.

Using real-world analogies (pharmacies, banking apps, video games), we explain how these basic building blocks power everything from mobile apps to advanced AI.

Whether you're just starting out or looking to deepen your understanding, this episode sets the stage for future discussions that build from first principles to more complex ideas.
