Welcome to a special visual edition of *Learning from Scratch()* featuring none other than **Pandolf**‚Äîour curious coding kitty!

In this comic series, we explore the **foundations of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** through the eyes of Pandolf as he embarks on a paws-itively fun learning journey. Whether you're a beginner trying to grasp the basics or a more seasoned coder looking for a charming refresher, these comics break down programming concepts into bite-sized, illustrated ideas.

## Issue #1: Classes and Objects

OOP begins with the concept of **classes** and **objects**. Think of a class as a blueprint and objects as the real-world things built from that blueprint.

## Issue #2: Constructor, Method, Field, Property

Next, Pandolf learns what makes an object tick. Constructors help build it, fields store data, properties offer access, and methods let it act.
