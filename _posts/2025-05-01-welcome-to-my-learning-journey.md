Hello, everyone! I'm Brennan Terre, currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Data Science at Deakin University in Australia. Originally, I created this blog to fulfill a requirement for my unit, SIT771 - Object Oriented Development. However, as I thought more about its potential, I realized it could serve as an invaluable companion throughout my studies, and perhaps even beyond!

I have been taking personal study notes in Notion, planning to integrate them into my Zettelkasten system, but I saw an opportunity here to document and share what I learn more openly. This blog is a reflection of my academic journey, intended not just for myself, but for anyone who might benefit from clear, structured explanations of complex topics.

One of my inspirations is Richard Feynman, a legendary physicist renowned not just for his groundbreaking work in quantum mechanics but also for his exceptional ability to explain complex ideas simply. He's perhaps best known for the "Feynman technique," which involves teaching a concept to someone with no prior knowledge, identifying your own gaps in understanding, and refining your grasp of the topic in the process.

Now, here's where things get interesting (and slightly quirky)! When I left home for Australia, I also left behind my adorable kitten, Pandolf. Missing Pandolf and inspired by Feynman's teaching method, I started verbalizing and imagining teaching programming concepts to Pandolf. Yes, it sounds pretty silly, but it’s surprisingly effective!

Initially, this blog series will focus on C#, a language I'm exploring deeply for the first time. My professional background is in Web Application Development, so diving into C# and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is both challenging and exciting. After completing this unit, I plan to expand the blog to include subjects directly related to my Data Science specialization: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

I hope this blog becomes a helpful resource for beginners and grows alongside my skills to eventually cover intermediate and advanced topics. Please bookmark the page and visit again soon. I promise it will be both fun and enlightening!

Happy coding (and learning with Pandolf)!!
